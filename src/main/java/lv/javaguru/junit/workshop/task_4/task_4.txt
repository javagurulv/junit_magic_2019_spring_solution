Write tests and implementation code
for TaxCalculator using JUnit framework.

TaxCalculator rules

Simple rule:
- Income up to threshold (20000) is taxed at 25%.

Hard rule:
- Income of more than threshold (20000) is taxed at 40%.

"Impossible" rule:
- Implement possibility to calculate taxes for different years
  with different threshold % rates for each year (use mock for this).

- Each time send email to government,
  when calculating income more then threshold.

Write tests first!
Tests should drive implementation!
After all refactor your production code and tests!
