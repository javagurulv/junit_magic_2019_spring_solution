FizzBuzz kata - introduction to TDD
http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/

For numbers 1 through 100,

Stage 1:
	if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
	if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
	if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
	else, print the number.

Stage 2:
	A number is Fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
	A number is Buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

Write tests first!

Tests should drive implementation!

Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach!

After all refactor your production code and tests!
